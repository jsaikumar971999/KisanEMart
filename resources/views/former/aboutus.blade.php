   Kisan e mart is an online agricultural marketing platform that makes viable to the farmer and the trader for getting benefited without the interference of the middlemen.
 As we are well aware that the demand and supply are the two key words for any marketing that will determine the price structure. Sometimes this price structure may benefits the farmer if there is an abnormal growth in the demand . sometimes the price structure may bring a huge deprevation to the farmer with the increase in the supply. We came up with a good solution as the kisan e mart stabilizes the demand and the supply and brings the prices to a persistent value.
We have done four things to help the farmers and the traders<br>
1.we stop the massive production of the crop by indicating the farmer that crop has already an extravagant cultivation. we provide the estimated price of the crop at the time of selling. At the time of crop yielding , the farmer can reserve a slot to trade their crop at a peculiar time/date  depending upon their requirements.   <br>
2. we also reduce the excess burden to the trader by making them reserve a slot for receiving the commodities by giving the mill updates. <br>
3.the each and every process in this scenario is monitored by the kisan e mart committee (KEMC) . it keeps a track and helps the farmers and traders from very intial stage to the final phase. It takes the requests of both the farmers and traders and put them into contact.<br>
4.we linked all the possible benificiaries and the schemes in kisan e mart.<br>
If you are a farmer/trader desires to receive all the benefits from kisan e mart . kindly mail us at indiakisanemart@gmail.com  and we will get in touch to help you and let us know how else we can help.</p>
